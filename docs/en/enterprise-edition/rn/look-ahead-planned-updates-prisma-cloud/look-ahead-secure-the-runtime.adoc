//CWP-61917
|*Intelligence Stream Versioning*

tt:[Approval pending]

|The upcoming release will introduce Intelligence Stream (IS) versioning to ensure improved backward compatibility with older self-hosted (on-prem) consoles and defender versions. 

The versioning guarantees that when an IS requires a console or defender upgrade, backward compatibility is maintained, reducing the risk of failures due to unsupported changes. Self-hosted consoles that cannot be updated promptly will continue to function even if newer Intelligence Feeds contain data these consoles cannot interpret. 
Additionally, this update will minimize disruptions from external feed format changes, such as modifications to specific fields in downloaded JSON files that could impact accuracy of CVE data or result in duplicate CVEs.


//CWP-61840
|*Support for Podman*

tt:[Approval pending]

|Previously, Prisma Cloud only supported scanning Podman images in the CI pipeline using twistcli. In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will introduce support for deploying Defenders on Podman containers, providing comprehensive visibility and protection for workloads running in Podman environments.

This enhancement will enable Prisma Cloud to deliver full protection for Podman containers, including continuous vulnerability monitoring, enforcement of compliance policies, and active runtime security monitoring and enforcement.

|*Scanning Support for Red Hat UBI Micro-Images*

tt:[Approved by Tal]

|Prisma Cloud now supports scanning of Red Hat UBI micro-images, versions 7, 8, and 9.

|*Support for Amazon Linux CVEs*

tt:[Approved by Tal]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will support CVEs that were marked as "not affected" by Amazon across all supported Amazon Linux distributions, including Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Amazon Linux 2023. Previously, false positive vulnerabilities were reported for the Amazon Linux CVEs marked as "not affected."

//CWP-58952
|*Improved Vulnerability Detection for Multiple Python Versions*

tt:[Approval pending]
|In previous versions of Defender, vulnerabilities were only detected and reported for a single Python installation on a host, even if multiple Python versions were installed. This resulted in False Negatives (FN), where vulnerabilities in other Python versions were missed. 

The issue is fixed in the upcoming release. Prisma Cloud will scan and report vulnerabilities for each installed Python version on a host.
