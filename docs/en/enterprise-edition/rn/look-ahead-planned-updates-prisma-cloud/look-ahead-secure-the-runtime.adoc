//CWP-61917
|*Intelligence Stream Versioning*

tt:[Approval pending]

|The upcoming release will introduce Intelligence Stream (IS) versioning to enhance backward compatibility with older self-hosted (on-prem) consoles and Defender versions. This versioning ensures that backward compatibility is maintained when an upgrade is required for the console or the Defender. Self-hosted consoles that cannot be updated promptly will continue to operate, even if newer Intelligence feeds contain data that the consoles cannot interpret.

Furthermore, this update will reduce disruptions caused by changes in external feed formats, such as modifications to specific fields in downloaded JSON files, which could affect the accuracy of CVE data or lead to duplicate CVEs.


//CWP-61840
|*Support for Podman*

tt:[Approval pending]

|Previously, Prisma Cloud only supported scanning Podman images in the CI pipeline using twistcli. In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will introduce support for deploying Defenders on Podman containers, providing comprehensive visibility and protection for workloads running in Podman environments.

This enhancement will enable Prisma Cloud to deliver full protection for Podman containers, including continuous vulnerability monitoring, enforcement of compliance policies, and active runtime security monitoring and enforcement.

//CWP-32911
|*Scanning Support for Red Hat UBI Micro-Images*

tt:[Approved by Tal]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will introduce support for scanning of Red Hat UBI micro-images (versions 7, 8, and 9).

|*Support for Amazon Linux CVEs*

tt:[Approved by Tal]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will resolve prior instances of false positive vulnerabilities reported for Amazon Linux CVEs that were marked as "not affected" by Amazon. The supported Amazon Linux distributions include Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Amazon Linux 2023.

//CWP-58952
|*Improved Vulnerability Detection for Multiple Python Versions*

tt:[Approval pending]
|In previous versions of Defender, vulnerabilities were only detected and reported for a single Python installation on a host, even if multiple Python versions were installed. This resulted in False Negatives (FN), where vulnerabilities in other Python versions were missed. 

The issue is fixed in the upcoming release. Prisma Cloud will scan and report vulnerabilities for each installed Python version on a host.
