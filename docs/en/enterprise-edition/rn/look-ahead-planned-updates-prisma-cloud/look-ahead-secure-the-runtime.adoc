//CWP-61917
|*Intelligence Stream Versioning*

tt:[Approval pending]

|The upcoming release will introduce Intelligence Stream (IS) versioning to improve backward compatibility with older Defender versions and self-hosted (on-prem) consoles. Versioning ensures that even if a console or Defender upgrade is needed, they will still continue to operate, even if they can't support newer Intelligence feeds.

In addition, this update will minimize disruptions caused by changes in external feed formats. For example, updates to certain fields in downloaded JSON files that could impact CVE accuracy or cause duplicate CVEs.


//CWP-61840
|*Support for Podman*

tt:[Approval pending]

|Previously, Prisma Cloud supported scanning Podman images in the CI pipeline using `twistcli`. In the upcoming release, it will also allow deploying Defenders on Podman containers, offering complete visibility and protection for workloads in Podman environments.

This enhancement will enable full protection for Podman containers, including continuous vulnerability monitoring, compliance policy enforcement, and active runtime security monitoring.

//CWP-32911
|*Scanning Support for Red Hat UBI Micro-Images*

tt:[Approved by Tal]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will introduce support for scanning of Red Hat UBI micro-images (versions 7, 8, and 9).

|*Support for Amazon Linux CVEs*

tt:[Approval pending]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will resolve prior instances of false positive vulnerabilities reported for Amazon Linux CVEs that were marked as "not affected" by Amazon. The supported Amazon Linux distributions include Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Amazon Linux 2023.

//CWP-58952
|*Improved Vulnerability Detection for Multiple Python Versions*

tt:[Approval pending]

|In the upcoming release, Prisma Cloud will address instances where vulnerabilities were previously detected only for a single Python installation on a host, leading to False Negatives (FN) for other versions. Prisma Cloud will now scan and report vulnerabilities for all the Python versions installed on a host.
