|tt:[Update] 
*Vulnerabilities Dashboard*
//PCUI-6499

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[*24.7.1*]


|The *Vulnerabilities* dashboard now provides 3 new widgets:

* *Overview*—Displays the number of *Unique CVEs*, total number of *Vulnerabilities*, and *Vulnerabilities Remediated*.

* *Vulnerabilities Funnel*—Displays the number of vulnerabilities, instead of unique CVEs and separates risks introduced by CVEs from the environmental ones.

* *Most Important Vulnerabilities*—Displays the top vulnerabilities and provides a direct link of assets at risk.

image::vulnerabilities-dashboard-1.png[]

You can also *CVE Preview Card*, which highlights the most important information about a CVE, without the need to click on it and open the sidecar.

|tt:[Update]
*CSV Bulk Download in Table View*
//RLP-130840

tt:[Secure the Infrastructure]

tt:[*24.7.1*] 

|Previously, you would have to download the CSV file per CVE, which was time consuming and tedious. Now, in the table view, you can select *Download > Download all CVE data* in a single CSV file. The CSV file is limited to 10K records. 

image::csv-bulk-download-table.png[]

|tt:[Update] 
*Vulnerability Results in Table View*

|*Description*

//CWP-57783
|*Severity Mapping Update for Intelligence Stream*

tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|The severity values for the Intelligence stream are now mapped into 4 predefined values: “Low”, “Medium”,“ High”, and “Critical”. 

Note: The severity values are already normalized to create rules. The current change is only specific to the severity reporting name change. 

The following list defines the new vendor severity mapping:

---

* *Current Severity*: Important
* *New Severity*: High
* *Vendors*: Amazon, Oracle, RedHat, Rocky, Suse, Ubuntu

---

* *Current Severity*: Moderate
* *New Severity*: Medium
* *Vendors*: Oracle, RedHat, Rocky, Suse, Windows

---

* *Current Severity*: Negligible
* *New Severity*: Low
* *Vendors*: Ubuntu

---

* *Current Severity*: Unimportant
* *New Severity*: Low
* *Vendors*: Debian, Suse

---

* *Current Severity*: Untriaged
* *New Severity*: Low
* *Vendors*: Ubuntu

---

* *Current Severity*: End-of-life
* *New Severity*: Low, Medium, High, or Critical based on NVD
* *Vendors*: Debian

Note: End-of-life will be set in the vulnerability status.

---

All the other unrecognized severity values from the different feeds will be assigned according to the NVD severity.

|*AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster automatic version upgrade disabled*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-144537

|This policy identifies the ElastiCache Redis clusters that do not have the auto minor version upgrade feature enabled.

An ElastiCache Redis cluster is a fully managed in-memory data store used to cache frequently accessed data, reducing latency and improving application performance. Failure to enable automatic minor upgrades can leave your cache clusters vulnerable to security risks stemming from outdated software.

It is recommended to enable automatic minor version upgrades on ElastiCache Redis clusters to receive timely patches and updates, reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities, and improve overall performance and stability.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elasticache-cache-clusters' AND json.rule = engine contains redis and autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false
----


|*AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment managed platform updates are not enabled*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-144577

|This policy identifies the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment where managed platform updates are not enabled.

Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) product from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides automated application deployment and scaling features. Enabling managed platform updates ensures that the latest available platform fixes, updates, and features for the environment are installed. Users must not  apply updates manually without automatic updates, risking missed critical updates and potential security vulnerabilities. This can result in high-severity security risks, loss of data, and possible system downtime.

It is recommended to ensure platform updates are managed automatically is crucial for the overall security and performance of the applications running on the platform.

*Policy Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-environment' AND json.rule = status does not equal "Terminated" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-configuration-settings' AND json.rule = configurationSettings[*].optionSettings[?any( optionName equals "ManagedActionsEnabled" and namespace equals "aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions" and value equals "false")] exists as Y; filter ' $.X.environmentName equals $.Y.configurationSettings[*].environmentName and $.X.applicationName equals $.Y.configurationSettings[*].applicationName'; show X;

|*AWS Lateral Movement to Data Services Through Redshift Cluster Creation*

|With access to the iam:PassRole, redshift:CreateCluster permissions, an adversary can create a redshift cluster with a more privileged existing role. this allows an adversary to access more datasources with the redshift service.

|When an adversary gains access to redshift:CreateCluster and iam:PassRole permissions, they can establish a Redshift cluster. Utilizing the Default Role functionality and AWS Redshift's inherent features, such as the 'COPY' command, the attacker able to move laterally in the environment is positioned to gain access to almost all sensitive resources in the environment.

|*Azure Lateral Movement via VM Command Execution Leveraging Managed Identity*

|Using this role allows running commands on any virtual machine in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/runCommand/action' an adversary can steal credentials connected to the VM and preform lateral movments from the accessed VM.

|Using this permission allows code execution on any virtual machine in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/runCommand/action' an adversary can use the assigned managed-identity connected to the VMs and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*Azure Lateral Movement Through SSH Key Replacement and Managed Identity Exploitation on VM*

|Using this role allows creating and changing virtual machines in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/write' and 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write' an adversary can update SSH keys for a given VM in the subscription and hijack the resource. 

|Using this role allows creating and changing virtual machines in the subscription, with 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/write' and 'Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write' an adversary can update SSH keys for a given VM in the subscription and hijack the resource. In this way, they can connect any VM in the subscription, use the assigned managed-identity connected to them and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*GCP Lateral Access Expansion by Making Cloud Run Publicly Executable*

|Entity can update cloud run instance code and public execution permissions, potentially with high permissions.

|Cloud Run compute instances often attached with a service account. Adversaries with the above permissions can update cloud run instance code and public execution permissions, potentially use the service account attached to the run instance, which gives them the ability to move laterally between different resources in the environment, on behalf of the cloud run.

|*GCP Project-Wide Lateral Movement via SSH Key Modification for VMs*

|Entity can update VM instance metadata for all project VMs and modify SSH keys for virtual machines inside the project allowing a lateral movement and hijacking virtual machines and using their identity.

|Entities with permissions to update VM instance metadata for all project VMs and modify their SSH keys can hijack  any VM in the project, use the assigned service account to them and move laterally between Vnets, environments and resources from the accessed VM.

|*GCP Cloud Run Job Public Execution via Default Compute SA Modification*

|Entity can update cloud run job code and public execution permissions, potentially with high permissions.

|Entities with run.jobs.setIamPolicy permission can modify IAM policies to grant rights (e.g. run.jobs.create, run.jobs.run ) over Cloud Jobs, enabling the execution of malicious jobs,that can lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement within cloud environments.

|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Enhancement to Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS Feeds*
//CWP-59772
tt:[Secure the Runtime]

tt:[32.07.123]

|Prisma Cloud now parses Photon OS and Amazon Linux OS feeds using CVE IDs as the primary vulnerability identifier instead of advisory IDs. This change enhances Prisma Cloud’s ability to correlate third-party data, and use vendor-provided information, including backports, severity assessments, and vulnerability scores.

|*Google Cloud Source Repositories*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-144967

|The `sourcerepo.googleapis.com` service has been deprecated by GCP CSP. As a result, the `sourcerepo.googleapis.com` service has been removed from Terraform.

*Impact—* Due to this change, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest metadata from the  `gcloud-cloud-source-repository` API for accounts newly onboarded after June 6th, 2024. However, for accounts onboarded before this date, the API will continue to be supported. The permissions check for `source.repos.list` and `source.repos.getIamPolicy` will no longer be conducted for these already onboarded accounts.

|*Tag-based Resource Lists*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-140177

|The following limits are enforced for Tag-based Resource Lists:

* Tag-based Resource Lists are limited to 10 key-value pairs
* Up to 5 Tag-based Resource Lists may be associated with a Role
* Tag-based Resource List Tag key and value is limited to 256 characters each

*Impact—* These changes will affect Tag-based Resource Lists and Roles after the release. Existing configurations will not be affected.

//Commenting out per feedback from AO 5/24 - check for 24.7.1 inclusion

|*Tag-based Resource List Support for Asset Explorer*

tt:[*24.7.2*]
//RLP-140151

|Tag-based Resource Lists RBAC is enforced for *Asset Explorer*— `uai/v1/asset` endpoint.

*Impact—* If user assigned role is non system admin and has assigned resource list, user will be able to fetch asset having assigned tag. No impact for user without any assigned resource list.

|*Change to Compliance Trendline*

tt:[*24.7.2*]

//*Change to Compliance Trendline and Deprecation of Compliance Filters*
//RLP-144230, RLP-144161, RLP-144168
//*Compliance Trendline Available Only up to Past One Year*

|The Compliance or Asset Inventory trendline will display data only from the past one year to provide better performance. Prisma Cloud will not retain the snapshots of data older than one year.

//The Compliance-related filters (Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, and Compliance Section) will not be available on *Asset Inventory* (Inventory > Assets).

//Starting with the 24.7.2 release, you will be able to access compliance trendline data only of the past 1 year. This change is implemented to optimize system performance and reduce data storage requirements.



|*New Limits for Audit Logs API*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-145079, RLP-142211

|To improve the user experience, a response size limit of 100K records is now implemented for the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rl-audit-logs/[GET - /audit/redlock] Audit Logs endpoint.

*Impact—* Requests exceeding 100K records limit results in a *413 Payload Too Large* error with _X-Record-Count_ header, which indicates the number of records that were being requested.

|*API Rate Limits — Update User Role API*

tt:[*24.7.1*]
//RLP-141323

|To resolve a critical performance issue with the https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/update-user-role/[Update User Role] API (PUT /user/role), a rate limit with the following parameters is now implemented:

`Limit=3, Burst=3` 

*Impact—* Requests exceeding these limits result in an *HTTP 429* Too Many Requests response.
