=== Description

This policy detects the usage of the 'apt' command within Dockerfile RUN instructions. The 'apt' command interface is considered less stable than 'apt-get' and is therefore not recommended. Using 'apt' can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security vulnerabilities.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Dockerfile*

To mitigate this risk, replace any instance of 'apt' with 'apt-get' in your Dockerfile RUN instructions. This ensures a more stable and secure package installation process within your Docker images.

Replacing 'apt' with 'apt-get' in the example below ensures a more reliable and secure package installation process.

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Bad example
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx

# Good example
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
