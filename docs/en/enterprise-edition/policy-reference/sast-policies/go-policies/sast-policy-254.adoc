=== Description

This policy identifies instances where Go applications set overly permissive file permissions using `io/ioutil.WriteFile`. Permissions greater than `0600` can expose files to unauthorized access. It is recommended to use more restrictive permissions, such as `0200` for write-only access, `0400` for read-only access, or `0600` for read/write access by the application user only.

In the following code snippet, the application sets overly permissive file permissions using `ioutil.WriteFile` with a mask greater than `0600`, which can expose the file to unauthorized access.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure file permissions
    data := []byte("Sensitive data")
    err := ioutil.WriteFile("/path/to/file", data, 0666)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, use more restrictive permissions when writing files. This limits access to the file to only the necessary users.

In this example, the application sets the file permissions to `0600` to restrict access to the application user only.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Secure file permissions
    data := []byte("Sensitive data")
    err := ioutil.WriteFile("/path/to/file", data, 0600)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
