=== Description

This policy identifies the use of the outdated RC4 encryption protocol from the `crypto/rc4` package in Go applications. RC4 is considered insecure and should be replaced with more secure encryption standards, such as AES.

In the following code snippet, the application imports the `crypto/rc4` package and uses RC4 encryption, which is considered weak and insecure.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "crypto/rc4"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Insecure use of RC4 encryption
    key := []byte("weakkey")
    cipher, err := rc4.NewCipher(key)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    plaintext := []byte("sensitive data")
    ciphertext := make([]byte, len(plaintext))
    cipher.XORKeyStream(ciphertext, plaintext)
    log.Printf("%x\n", ciphertext)
}
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, use stronger, modern encryption algorithms like AES from the `crypto/aes` package. AES provides better security due to its larger key sizes and more robust encryption mechanisms.

In this example, the application uses AES encryption instead of RC4.

[source,Go]
----
package main

import (
    "crypto/aes"
    "crypto/cipher"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Secure use of AES encryption
    key := []byte("a very very very very secret key") // 32 bytes for AES-256
    block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    plaintext := []byte("sensitive data")
    ciphertext := make([]byte, len(plaintext))
    stream := cipher.NewCFBEncrypter(block, key[:block.BlockSize()])
    stream.XORKeyStream(ciphertext, plaintext)
    log.Printf("%x\n", ciphertext)
}
