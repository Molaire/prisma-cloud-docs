=== Description

This policy is checking to confirm that an Azure Machine learning workspace is not set up with a private endpoint. Using a private endpoint can pose a risk as it exposes the system to access via the private network only, hence limiting the accessibility, scalability, and flexibility of the system. Private endpoints further risk a single point of failure, which can directly affect the availability of the whole application or service.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*ARM*

* *Resource:* Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces
* *Arguments:* managedNetwork.outboundRules

To fix the issue, you should configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace to use a private endpoint. This can be done by adding an outboundRule with type `PrivateEndpoint`.
