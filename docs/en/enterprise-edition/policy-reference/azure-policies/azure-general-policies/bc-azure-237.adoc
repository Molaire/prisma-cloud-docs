=== Description

This policy is checking to ensure that dedicated data endpoints are enabled in Azure. Dedicated data endpoints represent an enhanced level of security in a cloud environment by ensuring that data connections occur directly through private IP addresses within your virtual network. If dedicated data endpoints are not enabled, it could pose a security risk by allowing data to traverse over the public internet, increasing the risk of data interception or breaches.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

* *Resource:* azurerm_container_registry
* *Arguments:* data_endpoint_enabled

To fix this issue, you need to enable the dedicated data endpoints. This option enhances the security of your solution by limiting data traffic to private IP addresses.
