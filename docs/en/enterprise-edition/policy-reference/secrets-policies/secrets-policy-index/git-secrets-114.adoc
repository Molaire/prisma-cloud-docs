*Clarifai*

If your Clarifai API Key is exposed, immediate action is required to revoke the compromised key and generate a new one to secure access to the API. Follow these steps to replace the exposed key and update all dependent applications:

1. Log into your Clarifai account using your administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'API Keys' section within your account settings.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.

4. Generate a new API key by selecting 'Create new key'. Provide a name for the new key and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Clarifai API Key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Clarifai API Key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
