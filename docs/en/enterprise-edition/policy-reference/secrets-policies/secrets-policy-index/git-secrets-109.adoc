=== Fix - Buildtime

*Anthropic*

If your Anthropic API key is accidentally exposed, immediate steps should be taken to prevent any unauthorized use by regenerating a new key through your Anthropic account. Replace the exposed key in all relevant applications to maintain secure functionality and reduce security risks.

1. Log into your Anthropic account with your credentials.

2. Navigate to the API Keys section found under your profile image.

3. Use the menu next to your key to disable your API Key.

4. Once you are sure no applications break from disabling your key, return to this page and delete the token.

Upon replacing the API key, it is recommended to audit access logs and check for any abnormal or unauthorized usage patterns. This analysis will help assess any potential data breaches or security threats and aid in further fortifying your security posture.

By regenerating a compromised Anthropic API Key and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your access to Anthropic's AI services but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data flows. Regular review and management of API keys are vital to ensuring robust security in your integrations with Anthropic's advanced AI platforms. For comprehensive guidelines and security practices, refer to the latest documentation and support provided by Anthropic.
