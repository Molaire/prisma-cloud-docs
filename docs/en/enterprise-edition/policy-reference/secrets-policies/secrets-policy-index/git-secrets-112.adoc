=== Description

An Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key is essential for securing HTTP-triggered Azure Functions, allowing only authorized clients to invoke the function. This key ensures controlled access, which is crucial for preventing unauthorized data exposure and manipulation through the function. Secure management of this key is imperative to maintain the integrity and security of the applications reliant on Azure Functions.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Azure*

If an Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key is inadvertently exposed, immediate actions should be taken to revoke the old key and generate a new one, thus securing access to the function:

1. Log into your Azure Portal using your administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the Azure Functions app in question.

3. Access the 'Function keys' section within the platform features of the function.

4. Delete the exposed key and generate a new one by selecting '+ New key'. Give the new key a name and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that utilize this key to the new key values securely, making sure the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the HTTP Trigger to check for any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the security impact of the exposure and improve your protective measures.

By replacing an exposed Azure Functions HTTP Trigger Key and ensuring all applications are updated accordingly, you effectively safeguard your Azure Function from unauthorized access. Regular checks and updates of your security settings and keys are crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. For more detailed security practices and guidance, refer to the latest Azure documentation and support resources.
