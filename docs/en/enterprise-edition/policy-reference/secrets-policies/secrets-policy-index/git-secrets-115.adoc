*Azure*

If your Azure Machine Learning web service API key is exposed, it is crucial to take immediate action to revoke the compromised key and generate a new one to secure access to the service. Follow these steps to replace the exposed key and update all dependent applications:

1. Log into your Azure Portal using your administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the relevant Azure Machine Learning workspace.

3. Access the 'Keys' section within the Azure Machine Learning service.

4. Identify the exposed key and delete it.

5. Generate a new API key by selecting 'Create new key'. Provide a name for the new key and save the changes.

6. Update all applications and services using this key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Azure Machine Learning web service API key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
