=== Fix - Buildtime

*Hugging Face*

In the event of an accidental exposure of your Hugging Face token, you should take swift action to mitigate any potential security risks by regenerating a new token through your Hugging Face account. Subsequently, replace the compromised token across all applications where it was used.

1. Sign in to your Hugging Face account using your credentials.

2. Navigate to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.

3. Next to the exposed secret, select Manage > Invalidate and refresh or Delete.

After updating the token, it is advisable to monitor the usage of the new token through access logs to detect any unauthorized or unusual activities. This will help in assessing any potential impacts of the exposure and enhancing security measures.

By taking prompt action to regenerate a compromised Hugging Face Token and properly updating your applications, you help protect your access to Hugging Face's AI capabilities and ensure the continued security and privacy of your integrations. It is important to regularly manage and review your API tokens to maintain a secure connection. For additional information and security best practices, consult the latest Hugging Face documentation and support resources.
