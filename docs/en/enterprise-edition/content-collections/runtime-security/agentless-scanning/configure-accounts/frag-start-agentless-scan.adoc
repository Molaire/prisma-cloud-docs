== Editing Agentless Scan Settings for an Account in Runtime Security

Previously, agentless scan settings for cloud accounts were managed outside of Runtime Security.  You had to navigate to the *Cloud Security* > *Settings* page to edit agentless scanning settings. Now, you can edit these settings directly within the Runtime Security module. 

[.procedure]
. Go to *Runtime Security > Manage > Cloud accounts*.

. Click the *Edit Account* icon from the Actions column for the account. 

. In the *Account and Agentless setup* dialog box, go to *Agentless scanning* section.

. Modify the agentless configuration options in this section. 

 . Click *Save*.

When you enable agentless scan for an account, it is included in the next periodic scan cycle, which occurs every 24 hours by default.
