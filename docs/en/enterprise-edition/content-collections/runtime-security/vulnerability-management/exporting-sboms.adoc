== Exporting Software Bill of Materials on CycloneDX

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory of all software components, dependencies, and associated metadata within an application. The purpose of an SBOM is to provide clear visibility into these components, ensuring they meet security and compliance standards.

SBOMs can deliver the transparency that software users now demand by enabling a standard approach to understanding what is in an application and why.

Prisma Cloud supports exporting SBOM files on CycloneDX version 1.4 for functions, images, and hosts scans. SBOM files can be generated in JSON or XML format.

=== Download format for SBOMs

SBOM files can be downloaded either through API calls or twistcli.

==== API Configuration

Download SBOMs through the following API endpoints:

* /api/v1/sbom/download/images

* /api/v1/sbom/download/hosts

* /api/v1/sbom/download/vms

* /api/v1/sbom/download/scans

* /api/v1/sbom/download/registry

* /api/v1/sbom/download/cli-serverless

* /api/v1/sbom/download/cli-images

*Input parameters for the API calls*:

* *ID*: Asset ID of the image, registry, or the function.  Obtain IDs from scan results. An empty list returns all entities under the same type.

* *SbomFormat*: `cyclonedx_json` or `cyclonedx_xml`

==== twistcli Configuration

You can export SBOMs using the new flag in twistcli:

`--SBOM [file_format]`

The file format values are `cyclonedx_json` or `cyclonedx_xml`.

The SBOM output is concatenated with the scan results output. Use the `--output` flag to print the scan results and SBOM output to a specified file.
