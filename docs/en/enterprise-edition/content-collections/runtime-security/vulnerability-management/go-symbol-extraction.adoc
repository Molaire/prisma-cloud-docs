== Go Symbol Extraction
When scanning Golang binaries, Prisma Cloud extracts Go symbols by default. This enables accurate vulnerability evaluation for specific package names and symbols. 

Additionally, Prisma Cloud provides the ability to selectively disable symbol extraction, when unnecessary, to optimize the scanning process.

To disable Go symbol extraction, complete these steps:

* *Self-hosted edition*: Add the environment variable SYMBOL_EXTRACTION_ENABLED=False in the twistlock.cfg file.

* *SaaS edition*: Add the environment variable core-symbol-extraction-enabled=False in the Launch Darkly mode.

* *Using twistcli*: Add the --disable-symbol-extraction flag to the image scan command.
